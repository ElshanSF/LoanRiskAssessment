## LoanRiskAssessment
In this problem, we are asked by an Unamed National Bank to build a risk assessment model that predicts whether or not it is risky to give a loan to an applicant based on the information provided in their application. Traditionally, loan applications are processed and assessed by hand, but now the bank wants to move to an automated loan processing system. That is, the bank will provide you with loan applications that it has processed in the past for you to build a classifier for risk assessment, going forward, the bank will reject the loan applications from applicants labeled risky and approve the applications that are labeled safe by our model.

The relevant training and test sets are provided in the files: `dataset_5_train.txt` and `dataset_5.test.txt`. The training and testing sets are created from both approved and rejected loan applications that the bank has processed by hand in the past. The first 24 columns contain attributes for each applicant gathered from their application, and the last column contains the credit risk assessment with 1 indicating that the customer is a loan risk, and 0 indicating that the customer is not a loan risk. The names of the attributes are provided in the file `dataset_5_description.txt`.
